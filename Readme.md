Overview:

This package contains the implemention of algorithm TARGCN.  

run the code:In the TARGCN/model directory
"python Run_XX.py --mode train/test --test_para epoch_XX"
--mode : train or test
--test_para : Specifies the name of the saved model parameter file

To modify the hyperparameters you need to change the parameters in 'conf/PEMSD4.conf' 
and "PEMSD8.conf".
  
The code is associated with the following paper: 
Yun Song, Cong Jiang, Fan Wendong, Deng Zelin, Bai Xinke, "TARGCN: Temporal 
Attention Recurrent Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Traffic Prediction," 
   
Please cite this paper if you use this code.
