Overview:

This package contains the implemention of algorithm TARGCN.  

To run the code, one can change the parameter "DATASET" to specify "PEMSD4" or "PEMSD8" in 'model/Run.py', and run the Python file 'model/Run.py'. 
To modify the hyperparameters you need to change the parameters in 'PEMSD4.conf' and "PEMSD8.conf".
  
The code is associated with the following paper: 
Yun Song, Cong Jiang, Fan Wendong, Deng Zelin, Bai Xinke, "TARGCN: Temporal Attention Recurrent 
Graph Convolutional Neural Network for Traffic Prediction," 
   
Please cite this paper if you use this code.
